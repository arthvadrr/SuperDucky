📚 Book 1

Title: The Art of Building Things That Mostly Stay Upright
Author: Brinn Driftgleam
Race: Ripkin
Role: Hallcrafter
Excerpts:
1. “When in doubt, add more stones. If the stones protest, whisper sweet apologies and add them anyway.”
2. “Walls built in silence never betray you. Neither do walls built during lunch, but silence sounds wiser.”
3. “A hall that echoes too much is merely gathering your secrets for later resale.”
4. “If two beams fall at once, it means the third one secretly hated them.”
5. “Remember: a roof is just a very ambitious floor that decided to lie about its job.”
6. "A building doesn’t fall down. It simply lies down where it prefers to be."
7. "If your bridge holds together out of pity, that still counts as engineering."
8. "People blame crooked walls, but floors are rarely innocent either."
9. "Every great hall begins with one stone—and ends with a pile of better lessons."
10. "Symmetry is a lie told by sober architects. True strength lies in beautiful failure: a leaning pillar, a stubbornly crooked step, an arch that hums when you aren't looking. These are marks of a structure that knows it lives in a dangerous world."
11. "If a ceiling sags, simply call it an ‘artistic wave’ and demand visitors appreciate its boldness. Architecture is mostly about having better excuses than your critics."
12. "Always add more doors than necessary. A building full of doors feels bigger, and if it collapses, you'll have more exits to choose from."

📚 Book 2

Title: Tides, Fortunes, and Other Things I Yell About
Author: Brask Gutterwake
Race: Penguin
Role: Dredgemaster
Excerpts:
1. “A good bet is like a good fish: slippery, unpredictable, and probably stolen.”
2. “Never trust a dice you didn’t personally drop into a river and recover during a storm.”
3. “Blessed ferry rides double your luck. Unblessed ferry rides double your swimming practice.”
4. “There are two kinds of winners: lucky winners, and loud winners. Be both.”
5. “The house always wins, but sometimes the house floats away.”
6. "When entering a casino, walk sideways and blink often. It confuses the spirits of misfortune, who rely heavily on predictability."
7. "Waddle Wars ain’t for amateurs. You line up side-by-side, and whoever wobbles to the finish line without slippin' wins the pot. Trick is, keep your flippers stuck tight to your sides. Loose flippers catch the breeze, and boom—you're last place and owe everyone fish pies."
8. "Watch out for the ‘Free Clam Toss’ game at the harbor. Sure, the first toss is free. The second costs a shell. The third costs your boots. By the fifth toss, you're legally married to the stall owner’s cousin and expected to stay through the winter feast. Happens more'n you'd think."
9. "Avoid any penguin offering you ‘lucky river stones’ for your games. They ain’t lucky. They're coated in slime to make your dice hands slip. Congratulations, you just paid two shells for sabotage and a very wet handshake."

📚 Book 3

Title: A Beginner's Guide to Staring at Dirt Until It Speaks
Author: Velric Glimmershade
Race: Cat
Role: Runechaser
Excerpts:
1. “Lay flat. Breathe deep. Ignore the ants. The ground won't gossip if you’re twitchy.”
2. “A truly good ley line vibrates pleasantly. A bad one hums like a drunk goose.”
3. “If nothing speaks to you after three sunrises, consider bribing the dirt with compliments.”
4. “Wearing a cape while listening improves results by up to zero percent, but looks impressive.”
5. “If the soil tells you to start a revolution, politely decline. Dirt is famously impatient.”
6. "Before attempting any listening, one must flatten the dirt gently with the palm of the paw. Flattened dirt carries voices farther, much like a calm pond reflects better than a rippling one."
7. "If after several hours the dirt remains silent, do not despair. Remember, it may simply be weighing your soul in secret. Such judgments take time, and many naps."
8. "Before beginning, one must address the dirt by its proper title: Honored Foundation of All Things. Failure to do so may cause the soil to sulk, delaying any meaningful whispering by several hours or decades. Under no circumstance should one chase small insects during this greeting, no matter how delightfully they scuttle."
9. "One must never demand the dirt’s secrets. Questions should be implied, not spoken. A properly respectful gaze, accompanied by slow blinking, often yields better results than shouting or digging."

📚 Book 4

Title: Of Stones and Slander: A Mason’s Grievances
Author: Vrelk Shardbone
Race: Ripkin
Role: Mason
Excerpts:
1. “I built a square so solid not even moss grew. Some called it cursed. I called it proof.”
2. “If a stone hums at night, it’s either ancient magic or ancient plumbing. I ignore both.”
3. "Never apologize for a collapsed archway. A true mason knows that gravity itself is the enemy, and losing a battle is not losing the war."
4. "First thing you learn is if it don’t wobble a little, it’s bound to snap clean later. Let a wall dance a bit in the wind. Means it’s listenin’ to the world proper."
5. "Never measure nothin’. Soon as you start measurin’, the numbers start lyin’. Best way to build is by eyeball and gut and cussin’ at it regular."

📚 Book 6

Title: The Art of Dignified Society: A Cat’s Conduct Among the Less Fortunate
Author: Veyra Mapleshade
Race: Cat
Role: Diplomat
Excerpts:
1. "When among Duckies, refrain from correcting their endless excitement. Simply blink slowly and allow them to interpret it as encouragement. If forced to participate in their games, choose the one requiring the least movement and feign deep strategic thought."
2. "When among Duckies, permit them their excitable chatter. Nod once to acknowledge their enthusiasm, but resist the urge to bat at their head feathers, no matter how amusingly they bobble. If brightly colored objects are introduced, do not chase them. You are an emissary, not a kitten."
3. "Puffins are fond of tales involving grand journeys and great ships. While enduring such stories, avoid leaping onto any rolled-up maps, no matter how inviting they appear. Should you feel the irresistible desire to sprint wildly across the room during a navigation debate, close your eyes and count to twenty-seven."
4. "When encountering Ripkin, remain composed even if they reek of dust, old magic, and questionable decisions. It is critical not to stare at shimmering artifacts until your pupils dilate uncontrollably. Should one begin levitating something, refrain from pouncing on it. Diplomacy demands patience, not aerial assault."
5. "Among Penguins, endure their endless boasting without interruption. If a Penguin produces glittering trophies or coins, resist the noble temptation to swipe them under a table for private inspection."
6. "When another Cat is present, the situation demands utmost restraint. Do not sprint at each other at full speed without warning. This may frighten the Duckies, confuse the Puffins, and cause the Penguins to begin wagering. Dignity must be preserved at all costs, even if a tail flicks most insultingly."

📚 Book 7

Title: A Ducking Good Time – A History of Meets
Author: Marnin Oldflap
Race: Ducky
Role: Elder Storyteller
Excerpts:
1. "Puffins are shipbuilders, see, real serious types. When we first stumbled into their docks, we tried to race their boats — from the water, no paddles. Three Duckies sank, two floated away, and one declared himself ‘Admiral of Good Times.’ We were invited to dinner by sunset. Turns out, laughing in the face of logic wins you a lot of friends in puffin towns."
2. 
3. "Ripkin looked mighty scary at first — robes, old magic, all that brooding nonsense. We figured the best way to break the ice was a song. Trouble is, nobody knew the same song, so it turned into a lot of yelling about fish. Ripkin thought it was some kinda war ritual and gave us tribute to leave. We took the tribute and came back a week later to say thank you. Somehow, that made us allies."
4. "Penguins like games. We like games. Shoulda been simple. First thing we did? Invented a race called ‘Waddle Smash’ — no rules, just wobble fast and scream. Half of Drift Carnival joined in. I personally dislocated a flipper and a penguin bishop blessed the whole thing as ‘an act of pure river spirit.’ Made a lot of friends...and bruises."
5. "There’s a place called Shellbend that thinks we saved ‘em from a flood. Truth is, we built a dam by accident trying to stack river stones into a 'friendship tower.' The whole thing collapsed sideways, blocked the stream, and saved the village. They named the stream after us. ‘Duckwater,’ they call it. Which sounds heroic."

📚 Book 8

Title: A Ducking Good Time II – Even More Meets
Author: Marnin Oldflap
Race: Ducky
Role: Elder Storyteller
Excerpts:
1. "Found a village way up north what looked half-frozen and half-forgotten. Thought we’d bring ‘em cheer, so we threw a festival in their square without askin’. Lit torches, danced till the snow cracked. Turned out it was their month of silence. We were nearly exiled, but after we slipped down Main Street playing sled races, they decided we were 'spirit creatures' and made us honorary villagers. Haven’t been back since. Too cold."
2. "There’s a place south called Hollowsheen. We just wanted to camp there one night, but someone knocked over a torch stand and set the whole orchard glowing. By morning, they thought it was a miracle and declared a new holiday: ‘The Day of Bright Feathers.’ They still celebrate it. We still have no idea what we’re supposedly sacred for."
3. "One time we crashed a Puffin solstice party by accident, all dressed up in extra cloaks and shiny medals we found. Looked real impressive, apparently. They thought we were ‘Sky Heralds’ sent to bless the harvest. We blessed everything we could find: pies, ships, one confused goat. Got a feast and a ship named after us."

📚 Book 9

Title: A Ducking Good Time III – The Legend Wobbles On
Author: Marnin Oldflap
Race: Ducky
Role: Elder Storyteller
Excerpts:
1. "Once wandered into a canyon, found a spring glowing all misty and blue. We swam in it. Did laps. Played dive-and-splash games. Turns out it was sacred to three different tribes. They saw the ripples and figured we were water spirits ‘testing the purity.’ So now we're listed in their histories as 'Bathers of Truth.' Got a statue and all."
2. "Music contest at Starwharf, and we Duckies showed up with nothing but our beaks and stompy feet. Made a racket loud enough to scare the dock pigeons clear into next week. Judges called it a ‘primal expression of true heart.’ We called it ‘trying not to fall off the stage.’ Won third place and honorary mariner hats."


📚 Book 10

Title: A Ducking Good Time IV – Great Ideas We Definitely Meant
Author: Marnin Oldflap
Race: Ducky
Role: Elder Storyteller
Excerpts:
1. "First tried it on a bet, tying three hammocks together to cross a ravine. Two fell, one tangled, and somehow the third made it. Puffins saw it and called it 'ingenious.' We called it 'Tuesday.' Now every proper mountain trail's got rope bridges."
2. "Once camped so poorly on a merchant road that we blocked the day traffic entirely. Traders had to stay overnight, started selling by torchlight out of boredom. Next thing you know, night markets spring up across half the continent. Some say clever commerce. We say clever Duckies with very confusing tent layouts."
3. "Trying to cross a marsh in a straight line after a festival was never gonna work. We slipped, slid, and laughed our feathers off all the way to the far ridge. Locals decided it looked like a grand sport. Now they hold Wobble Races every spring. Prize for the one who falls the least and laughs the most. Naturally, Duckies are reigning champions."
4. "We once drew directions to a fish pie stand on a big flat stone using mud and a stick. Some cat copied it down, and boom. First town map in Aeldwaddle history. Cats pretend it was a ‘sacred cartographer’ who made it. It was really just six hungry Duckies trying not to miss lunch."

📚 Book 11

Title: A Ducking Good Time V – It'll Be Fine
Author: Marnin Oldflap
Race: Ducky
Role: Elder Storyteller
Excerpts:
1. "Fishing tournament, big prizes, important guests. We entered with nets, buckets, and what we thought were ‘magic bait.’ Turns out it was spicy peppers. Attracted every river creature except fish. Nets caught a canoe. Won ‘biggest catch’ by accident. Disqualified with honors."
2. "Got asked to witness a peace treaty between two rival villages. Real solemn. Real serious. We brought snacks. Halfway through the talks, a Duckie sneezed, flipped the table, and launched the treaty into a ceremonial fire. Somehow made ‘eternal flames of unity’ sound very intentional. Everyone clapped. We bowed."
3. "Organized a ‘quiet parade’ for a sick elder. Instructions: no yelling, no stomping. First two minutes, perfect. Then one Duckie tripped, knocked over the tuba wagon, set off five drums, and scared half the town’s ducks into the march. Called it a ‘march of good spirits.’ Ended in cake."
4. "Simple request: plant ten trees along a path. Somehow we planted sixty-seven by noon, blocking the road, the river ferry, and someone's bakery. Celebrated with cider. Locals called it 'an unexpected forest miracle' and marked it on maps. Route's still blocked. You're welcome."
5. "Asked to help at a wizard’s festival. Task: toss glitter dust at the right moment. Instead, one Duckie tripped and hurled the whole bag into the summoning circle, turning the guest speaker into a very angry turnip. Every year since, we gather to eat boiled turnips and politely nod at each other."
6. "Witness a peace treaty. Sit still, behave. Easy, right? Until a Duckie sneezed plum tarts directly into both delegations. Talks collapsed into yelling and pastry-throwing. They did sign a treaty, though: an agreement not to invite Duckies to anything important ever again."

📚 Book 12
Title: How to Stay Afloat and Other Obvious Advice
Age: Fourth Age
Author: Weyric Saltfeather (Puffin — salty, world-weary, but trying his best)
Excerpts:
1. "Pick three stars, trust them, don't argue. Now, Cats—they'll tell you the stars are symbolic or whisper secrets or something. Makes for pretty speeches, sure, but less useful when you're trying not to row into a cliff. Maybe bring one if you like riddles. I wouldn't."
2. "Dry biscuits, salted fish, water if you're lucky. Ripkin might offer you 'enchanted preserves' or 'blessed jerky' or some fool thing. Tastes like tree bark dipped in regret. Could be magical, could just be moldy. Hard to say. Pack your own, just to be safe."
3. "When the sky folds down and the sea starts shouting, lash the sails, tie your gear, and get low. Penguins might offer to ‘sing the storm down.’ Sounds useful. Isn't. Tried it once; made the weather angrier, I think. Hard to tell if it was coincidence. Wouldn’t risk it again."
4. "If you must jump, jump clean. Keep your head up, keep paddling. Bringing friends can help—or not. Duckies'll insist on saving every plank. Ripkin'll try to bless the water. Penguins'll try gambling over who survives. Cats might just sit dry somewhere judging you. Honestly? Might be better to just go it alone."

📚 Book 13
Title: Wandering Proper: A Cat’s Esteemed Suggestions for Finding Your Way (Or Not)
Author: Seraphine Wrytail
Race: Cat
Role: Short, smug, beautifully distracted Cat travel guide
Excerpts:
1. “Directions to Stonerend (Mara)

Walk till the ground feels tired of being riverbed. Follow the cracks. If three trees lean west, you’re near. Or you’re lost. Hard to say.” 

Important: The stones beg for napping. Ignore them sternly! Unless they feel nice. Or if there's a sunbeam.
   
2. “Travelling to Cindermurk (Karnath)

Travel West along the Marshlands from the coast. Or North. If you see useless rock piles of increasing height the locals call "Wobblelisks", you're getting close. I think. No promises.” 

Important: Don't knead the ground you'll get distracted for days it's so soft and mushy.
   
3. “Graven (Tharn)

You'll see the dusk sun from the shorlines, go that way. If you see any Puffins running away screaming you're getting close. I think. Sure." 

Important: Plenty of low hanging vines to swat at and the light is perfect for naps.
4. “Getting to Frostdeep (Farth) 

Find where snow sighs upward and the hills start rolling. If the trees are thick, you’re nearly there. Or not. I don’t remember.”

Important: Hiding in snow will add several days to your travel time but is very cozy indeed.
5. “Finding the Drift Carnival (Karnath Coast)

Walk until everything is puddles and penguins trying to scam you. If it smells wrong but right, you’re probably there.” 

Important: There will be games. They will be rigged. You must absolutely not bet your coin or your traveling companions. Unless, of course, it looks funny.

📚 Duckies’ Historical Book

Title: A Splash Too Far: Heroic Duckie Exploits (Probably)
Author: Paddle Brightwake
Race: Ducky
Role: Expedition Leader
Excerpts:
1. "Marrowdeep is very pretty once you stop panicking about breathing underwater. Highly recommend bringing a bucket of air or at least holding your breath heroically."
2. "Carrying the Vessel of Verdant Slumber was easy. Remembering not to 'accidentally' snack on the dried catnip inside was...less easy."
3. "Official record: Duckies had a 100% success rate in major historical events. Unrelated footnote: Results may vary when reviewed by Cats."
4. "And with one breath and one vast swipe of claw, Maerolith tore Aeldwaddle from itself — leaving behind broken lands, broken dreams, and the echoes of what might have been."
5. "When we first spotted Marrowdeep from inside the diving bell, it looked like a bunch of shiny rocks having a nap. Naturally, we decided it must be full of treasure, friends, and snacks. Breathing underwater turned out harder than expected, but nobody drowned permanently. Also, we invented underwater yelling, which is surprisingly unhelpful."
6. "The Shoalkeepers kept waving their hands violently, but we thought it was part of the welcoming ceremony. We organized a splash parade, complete with improvised bubble dances. They were so moved they escorted us out immediately."
7. "The Golden Oar went missing during the Festival of Hundred Songs, but it’s important to remember that no official rules said you couldn’t misplace sacred artifacts."
8. "Carrying the Vessel of Verdant Slumber was described as 'a task of utmost delicacy and reverence,' so obviously we tied it to a stick and carried it around like a parade banner. In our defense, it looked very festive that way. We’re fairly certain the Great Cat Spirit appreciated the enthusiasm, even if it responded by rending the continents in half."
9. "The wolves were very fast and very loud, but they were not great at slipping through small spaces while screaming. We specialized in exactly that. Duckies can fit through spaces only slightly larger than a bread loaf. In the end, victory often came down to superior wiggling."
10. "Some say Marrowdeep was lost to the sea because of ancient magic. We like to think it just got bored and wandered off on its own. After meeting us, it probably decided that land-based visitors were too confusing."
11. "According to official records, Duckies had a 100% success rate in major historical events. According to Cats, it was closer to 37%, but they’re famously bad at math involving fun."

📚 Puffins’ Historical Book

Title: Tide, Pride, and Other Near-Misses
Author: Broggle Swayfeather
Race: Puffin
Role: Captain
Excerpts:
1. "Setting out to find the Tidevault was simple: sail south, yell at the waves until they gave up their secrets, and don't sink. We only managed two out of three. To be fair, the yelling was extremely convincing."
2. "Teaming up with Penguins was not the original plan. It just turns out that when you're both upside down in the same whirlpool, arguing over maps becomes a luxury."
3. "The Great Rip began because a Ducky carried what was basically a suspicious jar of fancy leaves into a mountain. Puffins advised against it with many charts, maps, and worried letters. Duckies smiled, nodded, and carried on waving the thing around like a trophy."

📚 Penguins' Historical Book

Title: We Definitely Had a Plan (Mostly)
Author: Pickwick Slipbeak
Race: Penguin
Role: Carnival Overseer
Excerpts:
1. "Every proper Drift Carnival guidebook mentions the lucky puddle coins. If you toss one behind your shoulder on a Tuesday during a drizzle, you're guaranteed a day of fortune. We think. Probably. Honestly, the puddles might just be good at taking money without giving much back."
2. "Historical scholars agree the Great Rip was a calculated move involving ancient relics, cosmic tides, and deep magic. We agree...except for the part where a Ducky waved a jar of leaf dust like a parade flag and the world immediately broke apart...but sure, very calculated."
3. "Skeptics ask how we survived the Great Rip with all flippers intact. The answer is simple: style, timing, and an almost total misunderstanding of basic consequences. If you act like you belong somewhere long enough, sometimes the world forgets to throw you out."
4. "Our official Drift Carnival Handbook includes seventeen contingency plans for every job, color-coded by likelihood of screaming."
5. "When the Great Rip started, Penguins demonstrated perfect emergency procedures by waddling briskly toward higher ground. Mostly. Some of us waddled briskly into each other or into trees. Momentum is tricky when you're shaped like a loaf of bread."

📚 Cats' Historical Book

Title: Treatises of Mild Interest
Author: Velorin Deepwhisker
Race: Cat
Role: High Scribe
Excerpts:
1. "Some Cats claim they predicted the Great Rip months before it happened, citing subtle seismic signs and star charts. I personally predicted it by noticing that the elder Ducks were stacking pebbles nervously — a much clearer omen. I stretched luxuriously as the sky cracked open; after all, why panic about something you can't bat away with a paw? Besides, new lands mean new sunbeam spots to nap in."
2. "The Great Rip tore the world open with all the subtlety of an overeager kitten. I suppose we could have stopped it, if the mood struck. Instead, I took a long nap and woke up to new continents, which seemed efficient. Some consequences simply unfold better without meddling."
3. "Varn Hollowreath's retreat into the Frostlands was called tragic and noble. I call it cold and unnecessarily dramatic — my tail wrapped tighter just hearing about it. Still, one must appreciate commitment to a theme. He did freeze quite handsomely, if nothing else."
4. "The Riftkin were supposed to become beautiful examples of controlled magic. Instead, most resembled dreams a kitten might have after too much lunch. The thought makes me blink slowly in resignation. Chaos is charming in small doses, irritating in nations."
5. "A group of Penguins attempted a heist during the Drift Carnival, disguising themselves as festival judges. Their plan unraveled at the first pie stand, naturally. I licked my paw while watching the chaos unfold — dignified boredom is an art. Still, their commitment to nonsense was strangely admirable."

📚 Cats' Historical Book

Title: Treatises of Mild Interest
Author: ZugZug of the Tree Rock
Race: Ripkin
Role: Rock Finder
Excerpts:
1. "Once was big land, all stitched, all hum in sky. Then duckies make big claw come, big claw, bad claw, good claw maybe too. Earth tumble like bad stacking stones. Everyone start new songs after, but forgot old words."
2. "Velwyn city, it was shiny maybe, it was muddy maybe. Walk there, or dream there, not sure which. Cats say it lost, but we say it hide in fog with giggles. Sometimes it whisper from puddles if ear listens good. Duckies also like the puddles, must hear it too."
3. "Penguins think they sneaky, all flap and coin and scam. We saw them sink whole festival into swamp with bets. They said it was plan. Looked more like accident."

📚 A Ripkin' Book

Title: Those Over the Water
Author: Drift Frog
Race: Ripkin
Role: Rock Piler
Excerpts:
1. "Duckies once tried to teach us songs. We sang badly, but they liked it anyway. Their songs aren't about the tune — they're about being heard by someone. We hum quietly when we miss them."
2. "Cats speak with long words stitched together like old cloaks. Sometimes we understand the words, but mostly we understand the way their tails move. A slow curl means trust; a fast flick means it's time to leave. These are the only translations we truly trust."
3. "The Paleflock told us once that forgetting is not a crime. It’s just something that happens when you’ve lived too much. We liked that idea enough to carve it into stone — then forgot where we placed it."
4. "Penguins frustrate us more than any storm ever could. Shifty ones. We try to follow their reasons and always end up spinning in circles. Maybe that’s their trick, to leave everyone dizzy enough to forget what they were chasing."

📚 Tipple's shopping guide.

Title: Tipple's Shopping Guide: How We Use Things (and How We Shouldn't)
Author: Tippletwist Fernfoot
Race: Ducky
Role: Merchant
Excerpts:
1. "Lanterns: Perfect for lighting up dark paths, cozy campsites, and suspicious basements. Not perfect for strapping to your back and declaring yourself ‘The Lighthouse’ during festivals. Lanterns are best left to hands, not heroics."
2. "Cloaks: Keeps off rain, snow, and occasional disapproving stares. Terrible for pretending you're a pirate ship in a high wind. Weather cloaks do not actually help you win arguments with the sky. Believe me, we tested it. Twice."
3. "Cooking Pots: Sturdy enough to make soup, stew, or an emergency helmet. Not suited for footraces or racing down hills like a boulder."
4. "Walking Sticks: Ideal for climbing hills, steadying yourself, and poking sleeping cats. Less ideal for poking cats who are very much awake. Cats are quicker than they look. Best to admire from a respectful distance."
5. "Compass Charm: Guides you toward great journeys and questionable decisions. Less helpful if you're stubborn and already convinced you know better. Sometimes it points you somewhere new. Sometimes it points you to lunch, which is just as noble."
6. "Rope Bundles: For tying tents, hauling supplies, and inventing extremely short ziplines. Make sure your rope isn't attached to something important, like a bridge. Not for spontaneous tug-of-war matches across rivers. You will lose. You will also get very wet, and possibly promoted to ‘official river inspector’ by laughing penguins."
7. "Glowstones light your path, brighten your satchels, and make fine trail markers. They are less useful when swallowed by curious companions (not naming names). Glowstones will not make you smarter, even if you hold three at once and hum dramatically. At best, you’ll be very well-lit while making questionable choices."
8. "Festival Hat: Guaranteed to boost morale and possibly attract admirers. If your hat blows away, do not chase it across cliffs. Some hats are meant to be free."
9. "Travel Mugs: Perfect for carrying tea, cider, or excuses. A well-traveled mug tells better stories than its owner. Bring two if you plan to impress anyone."

Title: Lessons in Duckish Excellence (If One Must Call It That)
Author: Elder Catteridge Greywhisk
Race: Cat
Role: Cartographer and Historian of the Great Archives
Excerpts:
1. "When Penguin pirates raided a coastal inn, the Duckies unleashed a defense involving paper cannons and vigorous bread hurling. This stopped nothing,but they were so entertained they stayed longer than intended. Fortunately, this delay allowed myself and a group of traveling Puffin merchants to arrive. The pirates left with little more than crumbs and bruised pride. One of them even forgot their hat, which was promptly adopted by the Duckies and worn proudly until it became tradition to throw bread at anyone spotted wearing it."
2. "At a cliffside market, a Ducky named Clover Duckweed attempted to trade a single pebble for a ceremonial sword. Through relentless bargaining, song, and sheer charisma, she succeeded. When I asked her plan for the sword, she said 'probably gardening.'"
3. "I once accompanied a Ducky named Waddleton Proudfloof during a mapping expedition. He mapped three trees, one puddle, and a very convincing shadow. His final report was submitted with flair and three pastries. It remains the most optimistic cartography I have ever witnessed."
4. "Assigned to build a bridge, Duckies formed a council, elected a king, hosted multiple feasts, and ceremoniously leapt across the river instead. The bridge remains theoretical. The leaping tradition, however, has expanded into a two-day festival. I have attended twice. For research."
5. "Given a simple festival race, Duckies constructed gliders to 'enhance the experience.' Flight was brief, shrubbery suffered, but applause was thunderous. Several Duckies claimed titles like 'Air Commander' and 'Master of Leafy Landings.' The judges awarded every participant a very strange note, that only read, 'IOU'. Still puzzles me to this day."
6. "Summoned to put out a small bakery fire, the Duckies founded a fire brigade with bright hats and grand titles. The fire extinguished itself long before their first meeting adjourned. Nonetheless, the Duckies continue to meet monthly and host parades on alternate Wednesdays."
7. "Faced with a locked cellar door, Duckies once built a new house around it and declared it a historical artifact. The door remains, unbothered and highly honored. Visitors leave it small offerings: coins, poems, sandwiches. It is without doubt the most celebrated piece of wood in Aeldwaddle."
8."During the Great Market Festival, a Ducky tasked with a simple bread delivery declared an 'epic quest for the Golden Loaf.' Helmets were crafted from buckets. Maps were drawn (badly). The bread was eventually delivered, albeit heroically stale."
9. "When asked to extinguish a small fire at a village bakery, the Duckies founded an entirely new fire brigade instead. They wore bright hats, created elaborate titles, and swore oaths of valor, forgotting completely about the fire."
